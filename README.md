Python_U1_Bartender
===================

Thinkful Python unit 1 Bartender problem

Here is the extra challange stuff.
Extra challenges
If you found completing the basic requirements fairly straightforward then you should try to extend your app to add the following features:

Give the cocktails a name
All good cocktails should have a memorable name. Try to write a function which will name your cocktails. The name should be a random combination of an adjective and a noun (for example your bartender could make a "Fluffy Chinchilla", a "Salty Sea-Dog", or a "Fluffy Sea-Dog").

Keep 'em coming
At the moment you can only get one drink at a time from the bartender. A well trained pirate bartender should offer his customer another drink when they've finished their previous one. Try adding a loop in the main function which will ask the customer whether they want another drink, and keep creating new recipes as long as they agree.

Extension exercises
If the extra challenges were not a problem and you're running ahead of schedule then you could try to implement one or two of the following features in your app:

Multiple customers: The bartender could ask for the customer's name before they are served. They could then remember the customer's preferences for when the same customer asks for another drink.
Stock control: Even pirate bars don't have a limitless supply of ingredients. You could add a stock count for each ingredient which decreases whenever the bartender makes a drink. The bartender could restock the ingredients when supplies are low.
